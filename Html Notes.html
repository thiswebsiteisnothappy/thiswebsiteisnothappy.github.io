        <h2> The Machine powering the soviet union</h2>
        <p >
            The word Gulag is a russian acronym for the soviet government agency that supervised the vast network of soviet labor camps which emerged in the soviet union beginning in 1919.
            The english translation of the russian acronym states "Chief administration of corrective labor camps." At Its height, the Gulag Worked and imprisoned 10 to 15 million people. The massive influx
            of prisoners of the gulag requires an extensive system of surveillance and a cruel, unfair system of prosecution. The System of surveillance was called the KGB, or committee for state security. <br><br> The KGB's responsibilities include
            protection of the countries political leadership, surveillance of border troops but most importantly the "general surveillance of the population". How does one find oneself in the fair camps of the nation? you may ask. In the first chapter of Solzhenitsyn's Historical record of the camps,  "Arrest",
            , he describes the path one takes to arrive to the camps. "Those who go to the Archipelago to administer it get there via the training schools of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
            Those who go there to be guards are conscripted via the military conscription centers.

        And those who, like you and me, dear reader, go there to die,
        must get there solely and compulsorily via arrest." As I could not articulate the importance of this notion, Citizens whom find themselves being pulled into the machine arrive there to die.
        There is not a single fate which shatters oneself as irrevocable as being arrested by the KGB. Being arrested did not mean serving time for your crimes. Nor did arrest mean that you would be put on trial and are given civil liberties.The trial that you would be graciously granted is one
        consists of torture untill the defendent concedes to written confession. Confession. And what exactly would you be confessing to? Heres a hint. They don't have to tell you. if you are eventually
        told your crime, the titles presented to you appear as follows; "counter-revolutionary activity", "A negative attitude towards the collective farm structure", "A negative attitude towards state loans", "A negative attitude towards the stalin constitution" or "Friendliness towards the united states." In other words, all of these are designed to be as ambiguously broadspread and as universally applicable as possible.
        By the year 1918, the soviets had developed a efficient system for total investigation, arrest, interrogation, prosecution, trial, and execution. A system that would grow to become one of the largest sources of horrific suffering in the 20th century.

        After the arrest, the first places the prisoners were sent to detention facilities designed to force the
        prisoners into submission via violent interrogation. This was a necessary step in "maintaining justice", as the soviet propaganda would say.
        Shortly after arriving at the facility, the prisoner would soon meet his first cell. As one would look into his first regular cell,
        he would see a lice-laden, bedbug-infested room with a dirty concrete floor, no windows and no bunks. And of course the cell was also severely overcrowded with
        other fellow inmates. The jailers often pushed so many prisoners into one cell that all of the floor was taken, and people were forced to stand on
        eachother. In 1945, eighteen prisoners were pushed into a cell designed for the confinement of one person. Another example of severe overcrowding of prisons was in 1938 where one hundred and forty people were stuffed into a standard butyrki cell designed for twenty five
        prisoners. Despite the disgusting conditions one must face in his cell, this does not even compare to the treatment
        he would receive during his first interrogation.<br> Interrogations always took place at night to keep the prisoner from sleeping. The lighter methods include shining car lights in prisoners eyes, forcing them into freezing cells and then into airtight cells that cooked the inmate alive.
        As long as a confession is needed, torture was inevitable. The more severe the charge, the more ferocious the following torture would be. I will not describe the full list of torture methods used during interrogation for the sake of readabillity, However there are at least 31 methods described in the book, "The Gulag Archipelago".
        As you were taken from cell to cell, interrogation to interrogation, You would either be killed during interrogation, or you would sign your confession to be shipped off to the camps.

                When you arrive to your new life in the camps, you will also arrive to the place where you will either die, or be worked to insanity. Few people survive the full length of their sentence, and less people leave functional. The primary objective of the camps was to squeeze
                every ounce of utility out of a prisoner within the first three months. After that, their injuries would be too rehabilitating to upkeep the work quotas. They dispose of themselves to leave room for the newly arriving shipments. The work hours in these often reached upwards of 12 hours a day in the summer, and seven hours a day in the bitter, freezing. Winter.
                In the winter, temperatures would often reach as low as -50 degrees fahrenheit. Far too cold to exist for longer than for brief moments. But this didn't matter, the guards chased them out anyway, sent to mine coal or harvest lumber while buried to their waist in snow and ice.
                When the bodies were found, starved or frozen, they were simply hauled off and buried together in large anonymous pits dug by other prisoners. The work quotas for coal excavation by hand were at times twenty eight thousand pounds every day per prisoner. Note that
                the workers did not have contemporary tools to do this, they must excavate and move all of the coal with a pickaxe and a wheelbarrow. If the workers did not live up to this quota, their basic ration was minimized. When this happens, you were as good as dead.
